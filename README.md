# IoT_PROJECT_2
Ssnsors Used:
RGB color sensor(TCS3200)
RGB led
Arduino UNO R3

In the following project we will be using the RGB color sensor where we will detect the maturity of plants by detecting the color of the plants.
For example the dark green colour for young plants and pale green for matured plants.

In this project we will be detecting the colour and accordingly the RGB led will be turned based on the the need of the plant.

The TCS3200 is an aptical sensor which detects the light by using 16x16 matrix of every RGB colour and setting the pins S0,S1,S2,S3 accordingly.
We will be using the 20% frequency in this case.
